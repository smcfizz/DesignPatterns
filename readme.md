# Design Patterns

This repository contains examples of several of the most commonly used design patters. 
This repository is meant to be used as a reference to help visualize what certain patterns look like in practice and to 
provide a starting point for how to implement these patterns in your own projects. 

Design patterns are a somewhat higher level of abstraction and as such the approach to effectively implement a given 
pattern will vary from project to project. This repository is not necessarily a cookbook of pre-written code that can
be readily applied, but rather an example to help give the reader an idea of what they should be striving for when they 
implement the patterns into their own project.
